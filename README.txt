To get this code working:
If you are reading this, the source code is obviously up in the repository. 

Unfortunately its not clear at this point whether or not building with ant will work outside JME.

We are using an SDK to make this project: http://jmonkeyengine.org/downloads/, and sometimes it has failed to compile using a normal ant. 
Other times it seemed to succeed.

(we gitignore the stuff in the dist folder inside our project to avoid constantly pushing and pulling slightly modified massive zip files).

Our project is currently developing on another repository on github at github.com/evan13579b/Blade so that we didn't force others to constantly
download our big files if they changed.
